## Status

**Status**: Archived for reference only  
**Date Moved**: 2025-09-11  
**Reason**: Repository cleanup - Phase 4  

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Historical Reference**: These scripts contain valuable logic that may be needed for future reference
2. **Not in Active Use**: Scripts are no longer part of the active development workflow
3. **Migration Path**: Logic from these scripts has been integrated into:
   - Django management commands (`core/management/commands/`)
   - Service classes (`core/services/`)
   - Automated scripts (`scripts/`)

## Recovery

If any script logic is needed:
1. Review the original script in this directory
2. Extract the relevant logic
3. Integrate into the appropriate Django component (management command, service, etc.)
4. Follow current coding standards and testing practices

## Cleanup Schedule

These scripts can be reviewed for permanent removal after:
- 6 months of successful system operation
- Confirmation that all logic has been properly migrated
- No outstanding dependencies or references
